(*) It is higly recommended to use the userid and password as "secrets" of the repository. The secrets can be defined in the Settings options of the repository.
### Important note: We have notifiedÂ that passwords with special characters as $, are not well propagated as github_secrets, so, we recommend not use special characters if you are using github secrets. Anyway, you can escape the special character when introducing the password into a github secret and there should be no problem. For example: pas\\$word
